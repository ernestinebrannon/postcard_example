## Bio 

### Call me Ernie.

 I am a second year PhD student located in Eugene, OR. I study cogniitive neuroscience in the Psycholofy Depart of the University of Oregon. I use eye-tracking and virtual reality to conduct psychophics experiments exploring what visual illusions can tell us about how the brain gives rise to our perception of the world and how these are reflected in individual differences. As a first generation student and McNair alumn I am passionate about helping others navigate their way through the hidden curriculum.
