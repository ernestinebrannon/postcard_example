## Bio

Most broadly speaking my research interests span across cognitive and social neuroscience as well as metascience and science reform. I am interested in how neuroscience and psychology can be mutually informative. More specifically I am interested in studying how individual differences in social and perceptual experiences and behaviors relate to neurodiversity, pathology, and lifespan development.

Currently I am a research assistant in the Perception and Action Lab as well as the Social and Affective Neuroscience Lab at the University of Oregon where I am finishing my undergraduate degree in Psychology. I am also developing the McNair Data Science Series workshops where I will teach (and learn along with) my fellow McNair scholars the basics of data science.
